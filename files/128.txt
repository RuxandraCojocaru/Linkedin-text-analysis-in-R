About us
✨ We do things a bit differently love the start-up culture and cringe when thinking about corporate work set-ups. The vibe is hard to explain but it’s probably the #1 reason folks are building great things at HKR.
✨We have a clear mission and values;
✨We believe in action initiative and self-ownership;
✨We love feedback because that helps us move forward and improve but we love celebrating wins even more and that's why we keep an eye out for achievements whenever something unique happens.
✨We don't have office politics meritocracy is one of our core values;
✨We believe in action and self-ownership. We love feedback because it’s the only thing that moves you forward. We’d rather try and break a few things than sit on it. The biggest KPI we have is “How much did you care?” If the answer is a lot you did a great job no matter the outcome.

Location
👨‍💻 👩‍💻 We have an office in Cluj and one in Bucharest if you are close enough and interested in joining us there. We mainly work from home now but we miss face-to-face social interaction so we are happy to go to the office when possible. We were open to remote work before remote was cool and we’ll adjust to what time brings.
